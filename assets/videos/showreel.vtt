00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.360
this is blender open-source 3D software

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.680
that can be used to make animations

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.799
visual effects game assets or

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.000
practically anything 3D and best of all

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.519
it's 100% free and it always will be if

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.119
you've never used it before but you want

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.000
to learn it well then you're in the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.320
right place this is a tutorial for

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.160
complete beginners I've been using

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.000
blender for 20 years so I'm going to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.560
show you how to use all of its core

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.720
features and by the end you'll finish

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599
with not only the confidence to start

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.200
your own projects but with your very own

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.719
dut animation and I know this looks

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.520
complex but I promise you it's

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.840
achievable for a complete beginner and I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.600
say that with confidence because many

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.960
already have this is actually the fourth

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.879
version of this tutorial I made the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.640
first dut tutorial back in 2016 and I've

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920
been remaking it every few years to keep

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.039
up with blender's development in that

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.079
time millions of people just like

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.960
yourself have gone from having never

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.480
used 3D to successfully making their own

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.359
Donuts one arst even snuck his into a

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.440
little film called everything everywhere

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.479
all at once very clever so if you're

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.720
ready to take your first steps in 3D hit

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.920
the Subscribe button and let's begin

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.799
first go to blender.org download or just

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.000
click the link in the description then

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.360
obviously you got to hit the big

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.439
download button once downloaded on

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.360
Windows double click it and then just go

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360
through the install steps but if you're

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.280
on a Mac just drag it into the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.400
applications folder then just find the

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.560
blender shortcut and open it then once

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.439
it's open open just click anywhere off

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.360
the splash screen to close it and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.759
welcome to the wonderful world of 3D

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.240
first tip do not get overwhelmed if you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.880
go clicking around you might find lots

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.759
of buttons and some of them with very

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.479
scary names and it can all get very

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.360
overwhelming very quickly thing you need

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880
to know is blunder can do a lot of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.880
things which means it has a lot of tools

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.560
but you don't need to know every tool in

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.240
order to do what you want to do if

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.159
you're familiar with the 8020 rule

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.320
there's really only 20% of blender

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320
features that you end up using 80% of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200
the time and that's what I'm planning to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.320
teach you in this tutorial Series so

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.320
stay with me and you should be fine

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.160
we'll start making the donut in the next

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.879
video in this one we're just going to

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.480
look at the interface and I'm going to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720
show you some of the basic navigation so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.200
for starters this view this window right

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.640
here is your 3D viewport and it's where

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.680
you'll spend probably 90% of your time

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.560
because it is the 3D World so you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.480
see that we have three objects here

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.560
we've got a camera we've got a cube and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.840
we've got a lamp and when we click on it

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.599
you can see it's selected because it has

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.040
the yellow outline so let's delete the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360
default cube of course and replace it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.000
with something else so we could do that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.920
by going up to the add menu up here or

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.760
by remembering the hot key which is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.159
shift a so shift a for add so usually

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.959
the one you're looking for is underneath

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.720
mesh so these are called your Primitives

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.000
and it's what you use to start something

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200
when you're looking to uh make an object

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.879
like if you're going to make a chair you

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.959
might start with a cylinder as the chair

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.480
leg and then build out from there but

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.319
the one I'm sure you're all very curious

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.400
you want to click it it's the monkey so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.360
let's just click the monkey why does

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.599
blender have a monkey well fun fact

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.840
every 3D software has its own little

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080
random complex object because it's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.400
useful to test things like shaders or

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.720
complexities of scenes so 3ds Max has

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440
the Utah teapot Houdini has the toy and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.120
I think Pig's head uh blenda has the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.840
monkey and it's actually called the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.599
suzan monkey head which you can see in

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.920
the top left there named after the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.959
rangang from the film Jay and Silent Bob

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.879
Strikes Back random piece of trivia so

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.200
let's get a better look at it and to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.599
that we need to orbit which you can do

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.439
by on your mouse there your scroll wheel

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.200
that is called your middle Mouse button

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.400
if you push that in and then drag around

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.360
that is now orbiting now for my laptop

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.840
users you've just panicked cuz you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.120
realize you don't have a mouse how are

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.599
you going to orbit around first of all

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.720
probably good idea to get a Mouse for 3D

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.239
work it will come in handy um but in a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.280
pinch you can get by without it just by

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.959
up here in the top right hand corner

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.000
this little gray Circle anywhere in the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.319
gray section if you just left click drag

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.319
on that that will do the exact same

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.519
thing or if you want you can go to edit

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.120
preferences and then underneath input

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.280
there's emulate three button Mouse and

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.160
that means that if you hold down alt and

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.000
then left click drag that will do the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.360
exact same thing also whilst you are in

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.320
user preferences you might want to go to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.280
interface face and you've got resolution

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.600
scale if you're on a 4k monitor you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.400
might find that your menus and buttons

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.280
are really small and you kind of have to

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.919
like squint in to see it so personally I

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.160
like to keep my 4k monitor around about

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.400
1.5 but since this is a tutorial I make

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.720
it nice and big so you can see what I'm

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.639
doing okay so that's orbiting around

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.160
with the middle Mouse button if we want

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.320
to zoom in we can do that just by

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.960
scrolling in and out we could also do it

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.919
by going up to the magnifying glass tool

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.880
there and then just left click dragging

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.919
and then moving the uh mouse back and

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.440
forth that does the same thing or you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.400
could hold down control and then middle

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.520
Mouse button and that will do a smooth

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.080
Zoom as well okay so one thing you might

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.919
notice looking at this is that it's not

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.919
very pretty right it's just kind of got

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.120
this flat Bland gray lighting over

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.000
everything and that's because this state

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.560
right now is called viewport shading and

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560
it's kind of a lightweight optimized way

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.280
to view the scene just as you're

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.080
building it but if you want to create a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.280
final pretty image that's called r ring

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.960
and you can actually switch into

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.120
rendered mode by going up here into the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.080
top right hand corner you can see we're

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.240
currently in the viewport shading mode

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.240
if we go to across you should see render

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.840
View mode so if we click that your

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.520
computer might stall for a quick second

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.199
whilst it loads it in but you can see

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.680
it's now different we have directional

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.759
light we have shadow cast across the

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.360
monkey so it's now currently being lit

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.039
by this lamp up here so if I wanted to

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.840
uh you know zoom in on that lamp lamp

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.800
there and just kind of like move it

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.440
around you can see it's kind of hard to

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.120
focus on like it's always exactly not in

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.160
the right View and that's because we are

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.400
centered on our monkey right now we need

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.160
to change the focus we need to pan to

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.759
something else so we could do that one

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.160
of two ways one if you're on a laptop

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
you could use a little move tool there

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.680
that will do that or everyone else shift

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.000
middle Mouse click drag that will do the

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.720
same thing so middle Mouse is for

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.240
orbiting shift middle Mouse is for pan

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.080
to change your view to something else

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.680
okay so I want to move my light because

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.560
it's uh it's too Moody I want to be able

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.960
to see the monkey's face there so to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.000
move an object you could do it one of

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.720
two ways one you could go over to the

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.280
left hand corner here and you've got the

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.520
move tool when you click that you can

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.840
see that the selected object the lamp

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.720
has this uh this Gizmo it's called with

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.759
these axes on it and if I just clicked

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.919
and dragged on any of those arrows there

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.120
you can see I can move it along any of

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000
those axes I could also just click on

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.039
that uh white circle there and that will

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.479
just freehand drag it um depending on my

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.240
view but it's kind of tedious every time

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.319
you want to move something you have to

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.120
like go to that tool and then find the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120
arrows and yada yada so actually most

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.039
people in blender prefer to use the hot

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.960
keys so we just keep it in the default

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.000
selection State here and instead

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.199
remember the hot key which is G for grab

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.080
now I've just tapped the key and you'll

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.199
notice as I move my cursor that it's now

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.720
attached to my cursor it's not my cursor

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.280
isn't even actually close to it in fact

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.919
my cursor could be on the other side of

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.560
the screen and I could tap G and it will

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.560
move it and at first this is kind of

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560
awkward you're like why is it working

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.000
this way but once you get used to it you

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.440
realize it's actually handy because you

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.840
don't have to spend all this time like

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.720
navigating your cursor to something just

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.240
so that you can move it your cursor

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.159
could be over here and then just tap it

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:49.840
and you're moving it so whilst you're in

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.919
this move state if you want to cancel a

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.639
movement you can do it one of two ways

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.120
you could just hit Escape or you could

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.720
rightclick then if you want to confirm a

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.240
movement like say I want to move my lamp

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.599
here and I like the movement I could

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:04.319
just do a single left click so again if

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.759
I want to cancel something just right

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.599
click if I want to confirm the movement

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:09.159
left click but let's say I wanted to

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:11.280
move it along an axis like you know I

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.639
like these arrows here and I want to be

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.000
able to move it on just a specific axis

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.039
well I can do that whilst I'm in that

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.280
grab State as well so after I have hit

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.919
the g key to grab it I can then tap the

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.240
letter of the axes that I want to move

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.960
it on so if you don't know in the real

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.800
world and in the 3D software there are

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.280
three axis cuz there's three dimensions

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.640
there's the x axis which I can move it

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640
by hitting the X key the y axis to move

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.919
it back and forth along the Y AIS with

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.719
the y key or the Zed axis to move it up

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:45.000
and down on the Zed axis so you can

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
remember those uh those letters the X Y

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.720
and Zed or the method that I actually

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.839
prefer to use is whilst you're in that g

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.720
state if you just hold down the middle

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.920
Mouse button and then pull out you can

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.959
see you get this like Gray Line that

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:00.959
pulls out from the center and then if

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:03.360
you just drag out and move around it

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.320
will snap it to the nearest axis which

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.480
again is maybe an odd way to work but

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.959
it's actually really handy because it

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:12.000
means you don't have to think of the the

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.320
letter and locate it on your keyboard I

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.920
can just tap G to move it and then

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.480
middle Mouse drag out and then just find

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.160
that exact axis that I'm looking for and

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.240
so it's very fast to just quickly move

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.920
the lamp exactly where I want it by the

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.040
way if you're finding it hard to

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.640
remember all of the keyboard shortcuts

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.079
that I've mentioned I've actually put

00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:32.279
together a PDF a cheat sheet of

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.600
blender's most common hotkeys and you

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.240
can download that by clicking the link

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.880
in the description so you could print it

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.120
out or you could just have it on a

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.399
separate monitor while you work also if

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.519
you are from another 3D software package

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.480
you might notice that blenders hotkeys

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.519
are different than what you are used to

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.680
so if you actually go to preferences

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.079
just for those people that are from

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.120
other softwares if you change the key

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.519
map to Industry compatible you'll find

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.480
that these shortcuts are probably more

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.800
in line with what you remember from

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.880
other software

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.399
I'll also put a link to a cheat sheet

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.000
that is just for the industry compatible

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.920
keymaps that somebody else put together

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.240
I've got nothing to do with it but I'll

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.480
put that link there so you can check it

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.160
out as well for the rest of this

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.279
tutorial series I'm going to use

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.560
blender's hotkeys just keep that in mind

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.880
now let's say as I am moving around here

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.040
I'm like oh this looks really good I've

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.839
got some nice REM lighting across the

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.360
monkeyy face I want to take a photo I

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.600
want to take a nice pretty image of this

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.880
and post it on socials for clout right

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.600
well I could take a screenshot shot of

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.040
it but that would be silly cuz it's got

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.079
all these lines all over it's all noisy

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:34.560
right we don't like it the way you take

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.920
a photo a pretty image in letter is to

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.240
do a render so you could do that one or

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.800
two ways by going up to render and

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.000
hitting render image or remembering the

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.160
hot key which says next to it

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.760
F12 so when you do that a little window

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.040
will pop up it will use your CPU or GPU

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.399
depending on which renderer you've got

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.800
active and it will render out a pretty

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.360
image and from here you could go image

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.480
and then save as and that'll save it as

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.320
PNG or whatever wherever you want to

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.000
save it but you might notice looking at

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.480
this that this is actually a different

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.920
view than what we have here right so

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.240
here I've got a nice view of the

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.639
monkey's face but up there was a

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.959
different View and the reason for that

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:12.160
is when you do a render it's not

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.200
rendering from The View that you're

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.720
looking at currently it's always going

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.519
to render from the point of view of the

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.480
camera so this is our camera over here

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480
and it's looking from this angle and we

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.920
can actually look through the camera by

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.639
just clicking the little camera icon

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.959
there or by remembering the hotkey which

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.200
is number pad Z

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.399
zero so how do we move the camera well

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.880
blender is a little awkward maybe a

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.120
little different to other software

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.279
packages but you're supposed to like hit

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:40.639
G to move it and then like middle Mouse

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.600
to zoom in and out and then if you want

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.880
to like move it along an axis I guess g

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.639
and then X you could do that but

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.279
actually what a lot of users prefer

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.600
especially those from other software

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.760
packages is if you've got your camera

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.320
selected which by the way I haven't

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.000
mentioned this but up here this is your

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.320
outliner it's kind of an inventory of

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.480
every item that you've got in your scene

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.240
okay so with the camera there selected

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.320
if I hit n n is to bring up the

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.920
properties n for properties for whatever

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.639
reason um and then go to view there's a

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.480
little box there that just says lock to

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.880
camera to view so now with that active

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.440
if I just use the same keyboard

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.040
shortcuts as before middle Mouse button

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.320
to orbit around shift middle Mouse to

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.279
drag it you can see that the camera is

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.720
moving with it so essentially the view I

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.440
can set it up exactly as I want then hit

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.199
n again and then I can disable that and

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:36.920
then now as I pull out you can see the

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.839
camera will stay exactly where it was

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:42.079
and I could do a lovely pretty render

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.399
but this is too simple if we post this

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:46.120
on the internet people are bound to make

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.800
fun of us imagine that well we could

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.639
give it some color right so with our

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:54.000
monkey head selected we can go over to

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.320
here to the properties so this

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.800
properties section is where you might

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.120
spend the other I don't know another

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.079
eight five to 8% I don't know getting

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:04.920
too exact there you might spend another

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.399
5% of your time in this section but it's

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:09.880
where all of the properties for things

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.360
are in blender so for example you've got

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.240
uh like the render properties like the

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.240
size of the image that you're saving

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.040
something as is defined there and some

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.519
of these properties will stay here um no

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.920
matter what is selected but others are

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.120
selection dependent so you can see

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.000
actually if I click the camera there you

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.120
can see I get a little camera tab at the

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.440
bottom there but if I select my monkey

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.839
you'll see the camera tab disappears but

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:35.320
instead I have some other ones that

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.760
appear so one that we might want to

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.760
change is underneath material and this

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.680
will enable us to add a

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.959
material change the color to something

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:46.279
else essentially so underneath here

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.040
where it's got new I'm just going to hit

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.639
new and then you've got a bunch of

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:54.880
options very conf o i subsurface again

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.720
don't worry about it we'll get to all of

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.519
that later on the one that defines the

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:01.040
color is is the base color so if I do a

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.399
single left click on that white box

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:05.759
there I can then change this color to

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:09.360
whatever I want I could uh make it an

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.759
odd creepy skin toned monkey head right

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:17.440
like that and do a random okay so hey

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.920
all right it's better but still it's too

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.839
simple I think people will think we

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.959
haven't put enough effort into this uh

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:26.839
Masterpiece so let's add another object

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:29.880
let's give the monkey a hack so if we

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.920
want to add another object how do we do

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.120
it well we could go to the add menu like

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.440
I mentioned before or the hotkey shift

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.600
a so what sort of hat do we want to add

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.639
we could do a boxy hat uh let's do a

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:46.800
party hat with a cone so once we've

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.120
added that object you can see it's just

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.480
plopped it straight in the center

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.800
intersecting our monkey so we need to

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.279
move it can move it and we could grab it

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.160
with the G key so it's now moving it

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.079
just on our cursor there I don't want to

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:00.720
move it just freehand though cuz I like

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.120
the position but I just want to move it

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.440
up so I'm going to hit Zed to move it

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.680
along the Zed axis right I like it there

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.160
so once I like the placement I'm just

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.040
going to do a single left click okay

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.440
great but too big oh so see need to

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.839
learn another tool which is scale so we

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:20.720
could go to the scale tool there and

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.440
then we get this familiar um little axes

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.000
there but again most people prefer to

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.279
remember the hotkey which for scale is

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:32.839
just s so s to scale so resizing that

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:34.920
okay that's pretty good let's move it

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.800
down again so G and Zed okay all right

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.120
but yeah let's say we want to make it a

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.360
little taller okay so we could scale it

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.639
along just the Z axis so s and then Zed

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.519
whoops s z there we go and it's now

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:52.279
making it a tall party hat scale it down

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:54.399
there we go ha look at that be a very

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.199
Bland party if it's gray though so let's

00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:59.120
give it another material an exciting

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.399
color a vibrant uh

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:05.519
aqua color why not give that a render by

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:09.040
hitting F12 okay camera is in the wrong

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.120
position so let's go to camera view mode

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.519
with number pad zero I'm going to select

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.920
my camera and rather than dabbling with

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.759
that little thing I had before I'm going

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:20.880
to hit G and then middle Mouse just tap

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.160
it once as I said it's a little awkward

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.800
blend is um the way it handles with the

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.440
camera but anyway just uh move that out

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.920
and then uh I got to rotate it done all

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.480
right so I'm going to rotate so with the

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.560
camera selected tap r then middle Mouse

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.199
and it's now kind of like free hand

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:39.759
rotating around so I'll just uh move it

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:43.800
up slightly there we go okay this is

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.319
this is just a full around session so

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:46.519
don't worry if you're making mistakes

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:48.319
we'll get to actual practical building

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:50.399
stuff in the next part I'm just trying

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.560
to find ways to throw in these like

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.040
fundamental tools rotate right the

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.240
monkey's head is just he needs to look

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.959
dead on at the camera and currently he's

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:02.959
off ah what an excuse to use the rotate

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.520
tool so you could enable the rotate tool

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.839
right The Familiar axes there you could

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.959
click and rotate it around like that

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.400
again most people prefer to remember the

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.120
hotkey which is R to rotate right so

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.799
it's now just freehand rotating on my

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:18.720
cursor remember the uh the axis as I

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.079
mentioned before can be used for any

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.959
mode so uh the x axis will rotate it

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:27.120
back and forth the Y AIS tilt it or Zed

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.440
there we go to turn it towards the

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.919
camera just a little bit right and there

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.840
you go F12 and we've done it let's save

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.919
it let's upload it to Art station and

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.440
then just wait for the recruiters

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.160
essentially all right let's start a new

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.559
scene so that we can get ready for part

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:47.400
two where we're going to actually start

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.080
building our donut and learning some of

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.360
the more core features of blender so

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.039
click here and I will see you in part

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:57.039
two
